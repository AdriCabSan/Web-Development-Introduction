<!-- Sometimes, you'll come across a situation where you want to stop an event doing what it does by default. 
The most common example is that of a web form, for example, a custom registration form. 
When you fill in the details and press the submit button, the natural behaviour is for the data to be submitted 
to a specified page on the server for processing, and the browser to be redirected to a "success message" page 
of some kind (or the same page, if another is not specified.)

The trouble comes when the user has not submitted the data correctly â€” as a developer, 
you'll want to stop the submission to the server and give them an error message telling them 
what's wrong and what needs to be done to put things right. Some browsers support automatic 
form data validation features, but since many don't, you are advised to not rely on those and 
implement your own validation checks. Let's look at a simple example. -->
