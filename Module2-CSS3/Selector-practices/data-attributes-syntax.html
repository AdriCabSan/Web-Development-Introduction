<!-- We can use the `class` for styling in CSS, and we've also make this into a landmark region -->
<div class="names" role="region" aria-label="Names"></div>
What is discouraged is making up your own attributes, or repurposing existing attributes for unrelated functionality.

<!-- `highlight` is not an HTML attribute -->
<div highlight="true"></div>

<!-- `large` is not a valid value of `width` -->
<div width="large">
HTML elements can have attributes on them that are used for anything from accessibility information to stylistic control.



What not to do with data attributes
Store content that should be accessible. If the content should be seen or read on a page, don’t only put them in data attributes, but make sure that content is in the HTML content somewhere.

<!-- This isn't accessible content -->
<div data-name="Chris Coyier"></div>

<!-- If you need programmatic access to it but shouldn't be seen, there are other ways... -->
<div>
  <span class="visually-hidden">Chris Coyier</span>
</div>



<style>
/* Select any element with this data attribute and value */
[data-size="large"] {
  padding: 2rem;
  font-size: 125%;
}

/* You can scope it to an element or class or anything else */
button[data-type="download"] { }
.card[data-pad="extra"] { }

/* Selects if the attribute is present at all */
[data-size] { }

/* Selects if the attribute has a particular value */
[data-state="open"],
[aria-expanded="true"] { }

/* "Starts with" selector, meaning this would match "3" or anything starting with 3, like "3.14" */
[data-version^="3"] { }

/* "Contains" meaning if the value has the string anywhere inside it */
[data-company*="google"] { }

Case-insensitive attribute values
In case you’re needing to correct for possible capitalization inconsistencies in your data attributes, the attribute selector has a case-insensitive variant for that.

/* Will match
<div data-state="open"></div>
<div data-state="Open"></div>
<div data-state="OPEN"></div>
<div data-state="oPeN"></div>
*/
[data-state="open" i] { }

It’s the little i within the bracketed selector.

Using data attributes visually
CSS allows you to yank out the data attribute value and display it if you need to.

/* <div data-emoji="✅"> */

[data-emoji]::before {
  content: attr(data-emoji); /* Returns '✅' */
  margin-right: 5px;
}

</style>
