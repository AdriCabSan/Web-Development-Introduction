The very basic principle of inheritance is that properties with the value “inherit” will inherit its parent’s value for the same property into a computed value. Here’s a basic example:

red text

<p style="color: red; border: 1px solid #000;">
    <q><span>red text</span></q>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 10px;">
    <span style="font-size: 200%;">big text</span>
</p>
The property “font-size” with the value “10px” will be inherited into the <span> element. The span takes this value and sums up its property “font-size” by combining it with the inherited value. So the <span>’s property “font-size” will have the value 20px after the cascade.

Some screen properties already have “inherit” as a default value, forcing themselves on children in the document tree. Here’s the list:

border-collapse
border-spacing
caption-side
color
cursor
direction
empty-cells
font
font-family
font-stretch
font-size
font-size-adjust
font-style
font-variant
font-weight
letter-spacing
line-height
list-style
list-style-image
list-style-type
quotes
text-align
text-indent
text-transform
white-space
word-spacing




We set up some cascading examples here as a reference. Here is the sample HTML used for the test:

<p class="pclass" id="pid">
    <span class="sclass" id="sid">text</span>  rojo 1fuente de 15px
    <span  id="no">text</span> rojo  fuente de 10px
</p>

Here are some CSS scenarios that could reside inside the style sheet with results explained:

span#sid { color: red; }
#pid span { color: green; }

The text will be rendered green. Both styles carry the same weight (one id, one tag) but the green value is last defined.

#pid #sid { color: red; }
p.pclass span#sid.sclass { color: green; }

The text will be rendered red. The first definition has two id’s, (weight 200) and second has one id, 
two tag names and two class attributes (122).

#pid { color: red !important; }
span { color: green; }
The text will be rendered green. Even if the first definition is #id-specified with !important and colour will be inherited, targeting elements further down the document tree wins.

#pid { color: blue; font-size: 10px; }
#pid span { color: red !important;}
p #sid { color: green; font-size: 150%; }


The text will be rendered red in 15px size.
 Both definitions carry the same weight as default, but red wins the colour battle for its !important rule. 
 The span will inherit the #pid defined font-size: 10px; and combine it with it’s own 150%. 
 The result will be 10×1.5=15px.
